# Demographic Filtering
Demographic filtering provides movie recommendations based on general popularity or metrics like average ratings. It does not rely on individual preferences, but instead recommends movies that are widely liked by a group of people in geographic location. <br/>
# Content-Based Filtering
In content-based filtering, we recommend movies by comparing the content features (e.g., genre, director, actors) with those of movies a user has liked. <br/>
# Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering recommends movies based on the userâ€™s past behavior and similar preferences from other users. <br/>
